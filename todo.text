Vendors: Since admins can register multiple vendors, the Vendor entity would require thorough validation. This might include:

		Business registration details
		Contact information
		Bank account details for payments
		Verification of licenses or certifications

Customers/Patients: In a medical shop context, customers (or patients) would need careful validation:

		Personal identification
		Medical history
		Insurance information
		Prescription verification

Products (Medicines): Given that this is a medical shop, product information needs strict validation:

		Drug composition
		Dosage information
		Expiration dates
		Manufacturer details
		Regulatory approvals

Prescriptions: If the system handles digital prescriptions:

		Doctor's credentials
		Patient information
		Drug details and dosage
		Validity period	

Orders: Order processing would require validation for:

		Customer/patient details
		Prescription validity (if applicable)
		Payment information
		Shipping details
